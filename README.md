## Discussion
Travelling through flights has become an integral part of todayâ€™s lifestyle as more and more people are opting for faster travelling options. The flight ticket prices increase or decrease every now and then depending on various factors like timing of the flights, destination, duration of flights, number of stops, etc. Therefore, having some basic idea of the flight fares before planning the trip will surely help many people save money and time. In the proposed system a predictive model will be created by applying machine learning algorithms to the collected historical data of flights. This system will give people the idea about the trends that prices follow and also provide a predicted price value which they can refer to before booking their flight tickets to save money. This kind of system or service can be provided to the customers by flight booking companies which will help the customers to book their tickets accordingly.
## Deployment

The Code is written in Python 3.6.10. If you don't have Python installed you can find it here. If you are using a lower version of Python you can upgrade using the pip package, ensuring you have the latest version of pip. To install the required packages and libraries, run this command in the project directory after cloning the repository:

```bash
  pip install -r requirements.txt
```
